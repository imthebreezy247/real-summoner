League of Legends Real-time Item Recommendation System

This Python script is a real-time item recommendation system for League of Legends. It uses machine learning techniques, specifically the RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn, to analyze historical match data and provide item suggestions based on the current game state.
Features

    Fetch historical match data, player performance, and match outcomes using the Riot Games API.
    Train a RandomForestClassifier on the historical data to learn the best item recommendations.
    Provide real-time recommendations during gameplay based on the trained model.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    scikit-learn
    requests

Usage

    Install the required Python packages with the following command:

pip install scikit-learn requests

    Set your Riot Games API key in the API_KEY variable at the top of the script.

    Replace the summoner_name variable with your desired summoner name.

    Implement the missing functions, such as fetch_historical_data(), get_live_match(), and the recommendation logic in real_time_recommendations().

    Run the script from the command line:

python real_summoner.py

The script will fetch historical data, train the machine learning model, and start providing real-time recommendations during live matches.
Disclaimer

This project is a proof of concept and requires additional implementation to fetch and process data from the Riot Games API. Make sure to respect the Riot Games API usage policies and guidelines when using their services.
